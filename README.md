## RNAFlow: RNA Structure & Sequence Design via Inverse Folding-Based Flow Matching ##

RNAFlow is a flow matching model for protein-conditioned RNA sequence-structure design. Its denoising network integrates an RNA inverse folding model and a pre-trained RosettaFold2NA network for generation of RNA sequences and structures.
